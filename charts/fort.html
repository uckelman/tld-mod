<h2>KEY:</h2>
<ol>
<li>CAPACITY: Number of unit counters able to benefit from fortification at the same time.</li>
<li>DEFENSE STRENGTH MODIFIER: Units under fortification modify defense strength: 'x2' or 'x3': Defense strength of units multiplied by two or three. '2' or '6': Represents intrinsic defense strenght of fortification unit itself. '0': Defense strength of units not modified: remains normal.</li>
<li>BOMBARDMENT MODIFIER: Modify results of naval and air bombardment die roll by subtracting 1 or 2.</li>
</ol>

<h2>NOTES:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Coastal Strongpoints and Landfronte Fortifications, when defending only, can absorb losses like regular combat units. Each has one step.</li>
<li>Coastal Strongpoints and Landfronte Fortifications, and units DEFENDING under Fortified Aeas and Minor Forts are not halved when unsupplied.</li>
<li>All fortifications lose their zone of control when disrupted.</li>
<li>For Landfronte Fortifications, add intrinsic defense strength to the defense strength of the units under Landfronte counter.</li>
