<ol>
<li>This table is used for naval bombardment, air bombardment, and coastal artillery fire resolution. To use, cross index die roll with total number of strength points being applied to target hex. Result is either '&mdash;' = No Effect or 'D' = DISRUPTED.</li>
<li>Naval Bombardment: Allocate the desired strength points by sliding the marker along the track of gunfire boxes. No target hex may be fired upon using naval gunfire strength points more than once per turn. EXCEPTION: During the invasion turn, the Allied player may expend up to TWO rocket boxes in each coastal hex, regardless of other naval fire. Rocket fire may ONLY be used during the invasion turn against enemy targets in COASTAL hexes. Rocket fire is resolved separately for each rocket box used.</li>
<li>Air Bombardment: Allied player allocates light and medium bomber units to air bombardment missions by placing them in enemy occupied hexes and resolving the air/naval phase. Friendly units are not required to be adjacent to target hexes. Each hex may be air bombarded once per turn.</li>
<li>Coastal Artillery Fire: German coastal artillery units fire at Allied units in beach or port landing boxes during the air/naval phase (except invasion turn: beach assault phase). Each coastal artillery unit may fire at all landing boxes within range. Each box, however, may be fired upon only once per turn. Total all strength points firing at a landing box before resolving. 'D' result means each unit in a target hex loses one step AND is disrupted if moved to coastal hex.</li>
