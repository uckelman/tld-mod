<h2>KEY:</h2>
<ol>
<li>PORT CONSTRUCTION: Minimum of 14 turns to construct or clear. Place proper type of port marker on TURN RECORD TRACK indicating earliest turn of availability. After 14 turns, roll die on Port Construction Table. If 0 is rolled, port becomes operational. If additional days are required, advance marker to appropriate date.</li>
<li>MULBERRY STORM DAMAGE: At beginning of second storm turn and for each consecutive storm turn thereafter, roll one die for each Mulberry. If D is rolled, Mulberry is damaged; if a second D is rolled on a later turn, Mulberry is removed. If Mulberry is still under construction when die is rolled, add five turns to construction time for each D rolled.</li>
<li>CHERBOURG STATUS: German player rolls one die at beginning of each turn on German Demo column and subtracts number rolled from current Cherbourg capacity, until capacity equals &#8722;4 maximum. After capture, Allied player rolls one die at beginning of each turn and adds number rolled to current Cherbourg capacity. Maximum capacity = 36. Indicate Cherbourg capacity on track at right. Start marker on 12 box as indicated.</li>
