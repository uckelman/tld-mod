<h2>TACTICAL RAILROAD INTERDICTION</h2>
<ol>
<li>Allocate tactical air units (not HB units) to the Railroad Interdiction Box during the Allied Air Phase.</li>
<li>Compute total number of Interdiction Points and roll one die on the Railroad Interdiction Table. The number rolled represents both CUTS created on the mapboard and accumulated damage to he German rail system.</li>
<li>CUT markers are immediately placed on the mapboard rail lines by the Allied player.</li>
<li>Accumulated damage is indicated on the Indicator Track that runs around three sides of this display. Use the Rail Damage Marker to indicate progressive amounts of damage.</li>
<li>When Rail Damage Marker reaches 60, remove all CUT markers and TRAIN markers. ALL mapboard rail movement ends immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: Although German EB units can remove CUT markers from the board, the accumulated damage indicated on this chart is never reduced.</p>
